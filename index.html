          At the same time as COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on communities across
          the U.S., the national decennial census is happening. Originally set
          to end in July, the due date for the census has been extended to the
          end of October due to the coronavirus pandemic.

          In some counties there appears to be a small correlation between
          higher rates of coronavirus infections and lower rates of census
          completion. In the 10 counties studied, those with the highest rates
          of coronavirus among their population also had the lowest census
          completion rates.

          Using data from the
          <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">New York Times</a>

          <a href="https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates.html"
            >U.S. Census Bureau</a
          >, I studied the five most populous suburban counties in the
          metropolitan area of Washington, D.C. and New York City. Originally I
          was going to chart the cities themselves, but the New York Times data
          was not broken down by county for New York City.

          Westchester County outside NYC has had about 32 cases per 1,000
          residents, and has a census return rate of about 59 percent so far.
          Meanwhile, Fairfax County, a suburb of Washington, D.C., has had about
          six cases of coronavirus per 1,000 residents, and has a census return
          rate of about 73 percent so far.

          The completion rate is currently seven percent below the completion

          collect census data, in-person census taking is now on hold due to

          “I don’t think anyone was prepared to conduct the census in the middle
          of a pandemic,” said Jay Goldfinger, legislative and communications
          director for state assembly member Mathylde Frontus of Coney Island, a
          part of Brooklyn where census completion rates are well below 50
          percent. “What [the NYC census] did was the result of years of good
          planning and now a good chunk of that has gone out the window.”

          gets split up and how many House seats states get. Census data
          determines federal funding for things like schools, hospitals, and
          roads. Businesses also use census data to decide where to invest in
          things like factories and new stores, which bring jobs.

          The fewer people who respond in a given area, the more likely that
          area is to get short-changed in the future and struggle to get the
          infrastructure and funding to help with an economic recovery from the
          effects of the pandemic.
